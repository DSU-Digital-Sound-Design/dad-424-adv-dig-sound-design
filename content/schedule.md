  - groups can be made out of composers and audio implementers. For example, Iron Chef can have a group of 3, and Corrupted Mythos can have a group of 2.
  - Start by making a spreadsheet of all the required sounds and events. Note who made what sounds in the spreadsheet.
  - Sound Design students will create all sound effects and music. I'll make exceptions if there is a sound that is not practical to record.
  - Keep a journal of the process, noting who did what. I want to see that the responsibilities get divided as equally as possible.

  - Create an assets list for your project. Write your team members' names and the game you're working on on the assets list.
  - I will grade your project based on how much of your assets list you complete. The number of assets I expect will depend on your group size. Treat this assets list as a project proposal.
- Creating captures of the game to help compose or sound design with [Unity Capture](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/working-with-the-unity-recorder-2019-3#). After you capture the game elements, you can bring them into a DAW and start adding markers to those elements.
